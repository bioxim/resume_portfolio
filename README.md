# Getting Started with Create React App & Strapi 

The project consists of a template with 5 sections: home, about, portfolio (a list of my github repositories), blog and contact.

Techonologies applied:

- _**React**_ with _styled-components_.

- _**Strapi**_, as a database framework, with two main tables, one for the portfolio section and the other one for the blog (with a query to another category table).

Strapi is a real cool and easy thing to work with, despite of being unable to coding components where a pagination is needed (at least in the free of cost version).
